   * `load()` must be an async function that returns the current offset in microseconds, or
   * `null` if no offset is currently stored.
   *
   * `store()` must be an async function that stores a given offset in microseconds. Once
   * `store()` has been called once, `load()` should no longer return `null` if it did.
   *
   * `query()` must be an async function that sends the `request` buffer to a timesimp server,
   * and returns the bytes that the server sends back. If a transport error occurs, the function
   * should throw. For example, this can be an HTTP POST using `fetch()`.
   *
   * Due to internal API limitations, all three of these have a first `err` argument; this
   * must be immediately thrown if truthy:
   *
   * ```js
   * new Timesimp(
   *     async (err) => { // load
   *         if (err) throw err;
   *         return db.query("offset");
   *     },
   *     async (err, offset) => { // store
   *         if (err) throw err;
   *         await db.update("offset", offset);
   *     },

   *         if (err) throw err;

   * of waiting for a full round of samples. Errors from that store are ignored silently.
   *
   * If this returns `null`, not enough samples were obtained to have enough confidence in the
   * result, likely because the `query()` function encountered an error for most tries. Errors
   * from `query()` are not returned; you may want to catch them for logging before passing them
   * on.
